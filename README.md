## 👋 About Me

I am currently training in **offensive security and penetration testing**, with a strong interest in **Red Team operations**.

This GitHub profile serves as a **technical portfolio**, where I document:
- My problem-solving approach
- My enumeration and exploitation methodology
- My ability to analyze systems from an attacker’s perspective in an ethical and controlled environment

My focus is not tool usage, but **understanding attack paths, decision-making, and impact**.

---

## 🧠 Areas of Focus

- Ethical Hacking & Offensive Security
- Adversary Simulation
- Vulnerability Analysis
- Privilege Escalation (Linux & Windows)
- Post-Exploitation & Lateral Movement

---

## 🧩 What You’ll Find Here

- ✔ Hack The Box machine walkthroughs (when allowed)
- ✔ Methodology-driven writeups (enumeration → exploitation → escalation)
- ✔ Custom scripts, notes, and tooling
- ✔ Labs and controlled security research

Each repository aims to reflect **structured offensive security thinking**, not just command execution.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Environment

- Kali Linux
- Windows Active Directory labs
- Docker-based vulnerable environments

(Tools are used as means, not as an objective.)
