Aspiring **Penetration Tester** with a strong hands-on approach and technical background in electronics.  
Currently focused on developing real-world offensive security skills through **Hack The Box labs**, documentation, and continuous learning.

I prioritize **methodology, understanding, and reproducibility**, not shortcuts.

Preparing for **eJPTv2**, with the goal of progressing towards **CPTS** and **OSCP**.

## 🧩 What You’ll Find Here

- ✔ Hack The Box machine walkthroughs (when allowed)
- ✔ Methodology-driven writeups (enumeration → exploitation → escalation)
- ✔ Custom scripts, notes, and tooling
- ✔ Labs and controlled security research

Each repository aims to reflect **structured offensive security thinking**, not just command execution.

## 🛠️ Technical Environment

- Kali Linux
- Windows Active Directory labs
- Docker-based vulnerable environments

(Tools are used as means, not as an objective.)
